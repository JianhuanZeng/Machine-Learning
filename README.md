# Machine-Learning
Codes in basic algorithm of  Machine Learning, including the ridge regression, the naive Bayes classifier, the k- NN algorithm and logistic regression algorithm, broosting and so on.

## hw1_ridge_regression.m
I implement ridge regression to predict with ananlysis the effect of hyperparameter number and the effect of a pth-order polynomial.

## hw2_SpamEmails.m
I implement the naive Bayes classifier derived, as well as the k- NN algorithm and logistic regression algorithm (the steepest ascent algorithm and the Newton Method) to classify spam/no-spam emails.
