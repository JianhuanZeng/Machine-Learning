# Machine-Learning
Codes in basic algorithm of  Machine Learning, including the ridge regression, the naive Bayes classifier, the k- NN algorithm and logistic regression algorithm, broosting, k-means clustering, markov chain ranking and so on.

## hw1_ridge_regression.m
I implement ridge regression to predict with ananlysis the effect of hyperparameter number and the effect of a pth-order polynomial.

## hw2_SpamEmails.m
I implement the naive Bayes classifier derived, as well as the k- NN algorithm and logistic regression algorithm (the steepest ascent algorithm and the Newton Method) to classify spam/no-spam emails.

## hw3_kernel_boosting.m
I implement the Gaussian kernel model for regression to dataset 1 '/n'

I implement the Boosting algorithm for classification to dataset 2

## hw4_Kmeans_MatrixFactorization.py
I implement k-means clustering to dataset 1 '/n'
I implement the Matrix Factorization to dataset 2 for recommendation.

## hw5_MarkovChain_NonNegativeFM.py
I implement the Markov Chain to dataset 1 for team ranking '/n'
I implement the NonNegative Matrix Factorizatio for classification for Topic Modeling
