# Machine-Learning
Codes in Machine Learning, including classical ML algorithms, reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms.

## hw1_ridge_regression.m
I implement ridge regression to predict with ananlysis the effect of hyperparameter number and the effect of a pth-order polynomial.

## hw2_SpamEmails.m
I implement the naive Bayes classifier derived, as well as the k- NN algorithm and logistic regression algorithm (the steepest ascent algorithm and the Newton Method) to classify spam/no-spam emails.
